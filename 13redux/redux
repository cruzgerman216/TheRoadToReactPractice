Redux
- central data store for all app data
- any component can access data from ti
- makes state management easy

defining a central store to redux 
-> component subscribes to changes - props 
the component dispatches an action (contains optional payload) 
action passed to reducer and then the reducer updates the central state 

npm install react-redux is gonna allow us to connect with the store
react-app and our redux store

provider - provide our store
