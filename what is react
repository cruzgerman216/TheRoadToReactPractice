What is react
javascript library created by facebook
also used by netflix and instagram
used to create js-driven dynamic web apps
in that regard, can be compared to vue and angular

How React works 
- components, reacts job to inject them into the DOM

How does react do this?
- takes the JS and makes it into a virtual dom and then compares it with the old dom and 
then renders it into a new dom and only updates that one component if it changes. It does not change 
all of the website or components. 
    - This cycle happens when the data changes 

What are components and templates?
- components look like html templates (actuall jsx)
- They can contain 'state' (data UI state)
- they also can contain javascript for functionality
