        Taco Bell is an American chain of fast food restaurants based out of
        Irvine, California and a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, Inc. The restaurants
        serve a variety of Mexican inspired foods that include tacos, burritos,
        quesadillas, nachos, novelty and specialty items, and a variety of
        "value menu" items. As of 2018, Taco Bell serves more than 2 billion
        customers each year at 7,072 restaurants, more than 93 percent of which
        are owned and operated by independent franchisees and licensees. Taco
        Bell was founded by Glen Bell, an entrepreneur who first opened a hot
        dog stand called Bell's Drive-In in San Bernardino, California in 1948.
        Bell watched long lines of customers at a Mexican restaurant called the
        Mitla Cafe, located across the street, which became famous among
        residents for its hard-shelled tacos.
